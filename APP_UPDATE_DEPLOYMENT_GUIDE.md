## 📋 Pre-Update Checklist

Before starting any update deployment:

### ✅ Development Checklist
- [ ] All new features tested on both iOS and Android

- [ ] All tests passing (`flutter test`)
- [ ] No critical bugs or crashes
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] Accessibility testing done (if UI changes)

### ✅ Version Management
- [ ] Determine update type: **Major** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0), **Minor** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0), or **Patch** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1)
- [ ] Update version in `pubspec.yaml`

## 🔄 Version Numbering Strategy

### Flutter pubspec.yaml Format
```yaml
version: 1.2.3+45
#        │ │ │  │
#        │ │ │  └─ Build number (increments with each build)
#        │ │ └─── Patch (bug fixes)
#        │ └───── Minor (new features, backward compatible)
#        └─────── Major (breaking changes)
```

### Version Update Examples
```yaml
# Current version: 1.0.0+1
# Bug fix update: 1.0.1+2
# Feature update:  1.1.0+3
# Major update:    2.0.0+4
```

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Update Deployment

### Step 1: Prepare the Release

#### 1.1 Update Version Number
```bash
# Edit pubspec.yaml
nano pubspec.yaml

# Example change:
# FROM: version: 1.0.0+1
# TO:   version: 1.0.1+2  (bug fix)
# OR:   version: 1.1.0+2  (new features)
```

#### 1.2 Update App Store Compliance (if needed)
```bash
# If you added new permissions or features, update:
nano ios/Runner/Info.plist          # iOS permissions
nano android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml  # Android permissions
```

#### 1.3 Clean and Test
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter test
flutter analyze
```

---

### Step 2: Build for Both Platforms

#### 2.1 Build Android Release
```bash
# Generate signed Android App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release

# Verify the build
ls -la build/app/outputs/bundle/release/
# Should show: app-release.aab (your new version)
```

#### 2.2 Build iOS Release
```bash
# Generate iOS archive
flutter build ios --release

# Open Xcode to create archive
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

# In Xcode:
# 1. Select "Any iOS Device" as target
# 2. Product → Archive
# 3. Wait for build to complete
# 4. Click "Distribute App"
# 5. Choose "App Store Connect"
# 6. Upload to App Store Connect
```

## 📊 Monitoring Your Release

### Google Play Store Monitoring

#### Release Dashboard
```markdown
Monitor at: Google Play Console → Production → Release dashboard

Key Metrics to Watch:
• Install rate vs. uninstall rate
• Crash rate (should be <1%)
• ANRs (Application Not Responding)
• User ratings and reviews
```

#### Gradual Rollout Management
```bash
# Start with 20% rollout
# If metrics look good after 24-48 hours:
# Increase to 50% → 100%

# If issues found:
# Halt rollout immediately
# Fix issues and deploy hotfix
```

### Apple App Store Monitoring

#### App Store Connect Analytics
```markdown
Monitor at: App Store Connect → Analytics

Key Metrics:
• Downloads vs. deletions
• Crash rate
• User reviews and ratings
• Performance metrics
```

---

## 🚨 Emergency Hotfix Process

### When You Need to Fix Critical Issues FAST

#### 1. Immediate Steps
```bash
# 1. Fix the critical bug in your code
# 2. Update version (patch number only)
#    Example: 1.0.1+2 → 1.0.2+3
# 3. Test fix thoroughly
# 4. Build both platforms immediately
```

#### 2. Google Play Emergency
```bash
# Google Play - Can halt rollout:
# 1. Go to Play Console → Production
# 2. Click "Halt rollout" 
# 3. Upload hotfix AAB
# 4. Create emergency release
# 5. Release to 100% (since it's a critical fix)
```

#### 3. Apple App Store Emergency  
```bash
# Apple - Submit expedited review:
# 1. Upload hotfix build via Xcode
# 2. In App Store Connect, when submitting:
# 3. Check "Expedited Review"
# 4. Explain why it's critical
# 5. Usually approved within 24 hours
```

## 🔧 Automation Scripts

### Create Update Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# save as: scripts/deploy_update.sh

echo "🚀 DriveLess Update Deployment"
echo "Current version in pubspec.yaml:"
grep "version:" pubspec.yaml

read -p "Enter new version (e.g., 1.0.1+2): " NEW_VERSION

# Update pubspec.yaml
sed -i '' "s/version: .*/version: $NEW_VERSION/" pubspec.yaml

echo "✅ Updated to version: $NEW_VERSION"

# Clean and build
echo "🧹 Cleaning..."
flutter clean
flutter pub get

echo "🔍 Running tests..."
flutter test

echo "🏗️ Building Android AAB..."
flutter build appbundle --release

echo "✅ Android build complete: build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab"

echo "🍎 Next steps for iOS:"
echo "1. Run: flutter build ios --release"
echo "2. Open: ios/Runner.xcworkspace"  
echo "3. Archive and upload to App Store Connect"

echo "📱 Ready for deployment!"
```

### Make it executable

• Minor updates: Monthly  
• Patch updates: As needed for critical bugs

Best Days to Release:
• Tuesday-Thursday (avoid Monday/Friday)
• Avoid major holidays
• Consider your user base timezone
```

### 🔒 Risk Management
```markdown
Always:
• Start Google Play rollout at 20%
• Monitor for 24-48 hours before increasing
• Keep previous version AAB/IPA files
• Have rollback plan ready

Never:
• Push updates on Friday afternoons
• Update both platforms simultaneously without monitoring
• Skip testing on both platforms
• Ignore crash reports or negative reviews
```

### 📈 Success Metrics

Update Success Indicators:
• Crash rate stays < 1%
• User rating doesn't drop significantly  
• Download-to-uninstall ratio stays healthy
• No major complaints in reviews
• Performance metrics stable or improved
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Google Play Store Issues
```markdown
Problem: "Your app bundle contains native code, and you've not uploaded debug symbols"
Solution: Add to android/app/build.gradle.kts:
  buildTypes {
    release {
      ndk {
        debugSymbolLevel = 'FULL'
      }
    }
  }

Problem: "This release is not compliant with the Google Play 64-bit requirement"
Solution: This shouldn't happen with Flutter, but verify in Play Console

Problem: "Your app's target SDK version is below Android's minimum requirement"  
Solution: Update targetSdk in android/app/build.gradle.kts
```

### Apple App Store Issues
```markdown
Problem: "Invalid Bundle - Missing required icon"
Solution: Ensure all icon sizes present in ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/

Problem: "ITMS-90338: Non-public API usage"
Solution: Usually plugin issue, update all plugins

Problem: "Your account already has a valid iOS Distribution certificate"
Solution: Reuse existing certificate, don't create new ones
```
